Introducing **Sherwood Labz**, the generative AI productivity app developed by Sherwood Analytica. Generative AI is amazing when you have a good **prompt**, relevant **sources** of curated data and **tooling**. Choose from the list of prompts (or customise your own), upload your sources in PDF and/or free text, and synthesise your desired output. Use the cutting edge Gemini 1.5 Pro Large Language Model that can process up to 768,000 words. Please note that the **output may not be suitable or accurate**. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out", and it is possible that the output may be mediocre or nonsensical. You bear full responsibility over how it is used. Wish you all the best on your AI journey.
